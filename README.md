Milestone 4  - Context

Features:
Instead of using state and props, use context for the tweets list and creating new tweet


When creating new tweet, do not refresh the list, but add the tweet to the existing local list
Instead set an interval that gets updates from the server of tweets, in case someone else added a tweet (to keep the list updated)
